- First one, and the most important is that I have had the possibility to work with a completely new frameworks: VueJS.
- Create a search var where introduce a text to look for gifs.
- The gifs come from an external API, provided by Giphy.
- Results are listed in a grid and each result is a link that goes to the original Giphy page to take the url of the gif or other info you want.
